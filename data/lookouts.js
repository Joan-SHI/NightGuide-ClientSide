      "The original Brooklyn wind turbine, on the hills above Wellington, was the oldest operating wind turbine in New Zealand. It began generating in 1993 and operated reliably for 17 years before any major repairs were required. In 2010 the wind turbine was out of commission for several months while Meridian Energy, the wind turbine's operator, waited for the delivery of parts to repair it."

      "From Wellington’s CBD it is 30 minutes to the start of the Southern Walkway on Oriental Parade, and then another 25 – 35 minutes to the summit of Mount Victoria. On the way back you’ll probably take half as much time on your way down, so 15 minutes, and then 30 minutes back to the start of the walk. So allow for 2 hours in total for the walk."

      "From the car park (off Orangi Kaupapa Road) follow the grassy walkway to the Stellin Memorial. Head in to the pines on the left of the memorial. You will come to an intersection, turn left (down a flight of steps) to reach a sealed road that will take you to the Te Ahumairangi Hill look out. At the lookout take the steps up to the picnic area and then on to the sealed road (the Ridgeline Track) heading uphill briefly. You will see a sign that points you down the hill to the Northern Walkway. Take this track in to the bush."

      "Check out the red-coloured rocks that were formed 200 years ago. Maori folklore tells two stories relating to the colour of the rocks. In one, Kupe - the famous Polynesian explorer - was gathering paua (shellfish) here when one clamped his hand. He bled and stained the rocks red. In the other story, the red is the blood of Kupe's daughters. Fearing for their father's safety on a long voyage, they gashed themselves in grief over his absence."
